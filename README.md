**Mepo Hub** is an unlocked school web proxy that allows users to bypass restrictions and access websites easily.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔹 **Bypasses restrictions** at school and other networks
- 🔹 **User-friendly with a simple id system that can be easily modified and redeployed to create your own links**

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mepoify/proxy.git
cd (path)

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the proxy server
node server.js
```

> **Note:** Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed before running the server.

## 🌍 Usage

If you want to test Mepo Hub locally, follow the installation steps above. However, if you just want to access it without any complications, you can use the live versions:

🔗 **[Project Website on Vercel](https://proxy-yaseen-tahas-projects.vercel.app)**  
🔗 **[Project Website on Railway](https://proxy-production-7396.up.railway.app)**  

Login password: **mepomin**

> **Note:** I am well aware that you can bypass the password by going to `oneofareurls.app/index.html` directly this will be fixed later.
